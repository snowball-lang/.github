```
In the land of Snowball, where the code is king,
A language of speed and security we bring.
Object-oriented, it makes programming fun,
With a high-level view that's second to none.

Simplicity is key, complexity we shun,
Writing code is now an easy-run.
The power of Snowball, it's easy to see,
A language for all, just try it and you'll agree.

Fast and secure, Snowball stands tall,
With low-level speed that's the envy of all.
So let your code run and your dreams take flight,
In the land of Snowball, where everything's right.
